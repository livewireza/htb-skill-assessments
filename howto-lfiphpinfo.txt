Using phpinfo
This relies on the ability to access and locate php configuration of the target. This could by accessing and
locating [phpinfo.php]. The code below can be used and modified as per your scenario to gain shell access. 
Remember to change on [REQ1] variable to the correct phpconf file you found. 
Also Make sure to put in the value of [phpsessid] in the code. Change on [local_ip] and [local_port] in the variable [PAYLOAD] to point to your ip and the port of your listener.
